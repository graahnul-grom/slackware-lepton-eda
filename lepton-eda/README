Lepton EDA (Lepton Electronic Design Automation)

The Lepton EDA suite provides schematic capture, netlisting, bill
of materials generation, and many other features. It was forked
from the gEDA/gaf suite in late 2016.

The file format for schematics remains the same, and Lepton EDA
can be used as a drop-in replacement for geda-gaf, though parallel
installation is also supported (all programs have been renamed).

Many bugs have been fixed and new features added. It's in active
development and well supported.
